How to use the module
---------------------

The module requires JQuery so you need to add jquery to your Page_Controller class.  
Make sure JQuery isn't added by any other module or else it might not work properly. 
To add jquery to your Page_Controller class, add the following to the init method (see example below) :

```php
	public function init() {
		parent::init();
		
    Requirements::javascript(FRAMEWORK_DIR.'/thirdparty/jquery/jquery.min.js');
    
  }  
```

You can display the carousel to any of your templates.  For example if you want to add the carousel to
your Layout/Page.ss file, add the following to the template:

```php

  $CycleCarouselObject

```
