composer require "ajshort/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions:*"

## How to use the module

The module requires JQuery so you need to add jquery to your Page_Controller class.  
Make sure JQuery isn't added by any other module or else it might not work properly. 
To add jquery to your Page_Controller class, add the following to the init method (see example below) :

```php

	public function init() {
		parent::init();
		
    Requirements::javascript(FRAMEWORK_DIR.'/thirdparty/jquery/jquery.min.js');
    
  }

```

You can display the carousel to any of your templates.  For example if you want to add the carousel to
your Layout/Page.ss file, add the following to the template:

```php

  $CycleCarouselObject

```
There are heaps of configuration you can apply to the carousel.  All can be set in the template by putting specific
"data-cycle" value. If you wish to customize the template, copy the CarouselTemplate.ss file to your themes template/Include folder.
